`How BSTS work?`
- Every parent node has at most **two** children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent

`The BinarySearchTree class`
```js
class BinarySearchTree{
    constructor(){
        this.root = null;
    }
}

class Node{
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```
